    <p class="highlight">My name is Colton Arthur Allen and Iâ€™m a professional web designer and developer located in the Inland Empire, CA.<!-- Working as a front-end web developer at a marketing firm who partners with one of the largest beauty product retailers in the world has taught me a great many things when it comes to properly built websites that are user friendly and performant. --></p>

    <p>I offer an <span style="font-style:italic;">array</span> of web services with a new, more affordable alternative than a traditional web design firm: all the benefits of superior quality, fast turnaround times, and the personal touch with 24/7 customer service, all at an affordable subscription model.</p>

    <p>Because I'm not a large-scale web design firm it affords me the ability to give you and your website the attention it deserves. And because I do all of the work myself, from designing to developing, to SEO strategy, even to the copywriting, your site will be built faster with more focus upon it, </p>

    <p>You can learn more about me on my <a href="/about/">about page</a>.</p>
